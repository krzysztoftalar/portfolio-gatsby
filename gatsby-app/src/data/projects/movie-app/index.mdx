metaDescription: Cross-platform application for browsing new movies. It is completely written in Dart and Flutter framework using the BLoC pattern.

A simple mobile application that allows you to search for movies using free TMDb API.
The use of the Flutter framework allowed to creation of the application for Android and iOS devices using one codebase.
To build an easy to develop and maintainable app, I split the code into independent layers and depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
To manage state, I used the Bloc library to separate the presentation from the business logic.

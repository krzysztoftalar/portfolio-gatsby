metaDescription: Desktop social networking application for Windows developed in WPF and .NET Core.
---

I created this application for educational purposes only, mainly ASP.NET Web API and Entity Framework.
The app allows users to set up their account, upload photos, watch other users, and chat with each other in
real-time. I built the application server in .Net Core framework and Microsoft SQL Server and deployed it to Azure.
The front-end uses WPF, which allows creating desktop client applications.
A full list of used technologies and source code is available at the GitHub repository.

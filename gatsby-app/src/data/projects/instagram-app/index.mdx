The application allows users to set up their account,
upload photos, watch other users, and chat with each other in
real-time. I built the application server in .Net Core
framework and Microsoft SQL Server and deployed it to Azure. The front-end uses WPF,
which allows creating desktop client applications. A full
list of used technologies and source code is available at the
GitHub repository. If you would like to test my work, download the package from live link.
First, install the certificate and then the application.
Of course, you can uninstall it at any time like any other program.
